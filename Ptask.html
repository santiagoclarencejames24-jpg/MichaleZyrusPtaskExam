<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>A major controversy emerged around PhilHealth's reserves. PhilHealth has approximately P492 billion in cash reserves and is operating on a P284 billion budget for 2025 despite receiving zero government subsidy [Philippine News Agency](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1240065)  Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa noted that PhilHealth's utilization rate was only 63% in 2024, creating a surplus of P150 billion.</p>

<p>The government transferred P89.8 billion from PhilHealth's excess funds to finance other programs, including COVID-era service allowances for frontline workers. While officials argue these funds were underutilized, health advocates worry this sets a dangerous precedent that could weaken the insurance system when expanded benefits increase utilization.</p>

<h2>More Proof</h2>
<div class="more">
<h3>1.Structural Challenges Beyond Funding</h3>
<p>Money alone cannot solve the Philippines' healthcare crisis. The system faces multiple deep-rooted challenges.</p>
</div>
<div class="more">
<h3>2.Workforce Crisis</h3>
<p>The Philippines has fewer than eight doctors per 10,000 people, falling short of the international minimum standard of 10, with a shortage of at least 127,000 nurses(Ateneo de Manila University). </p>
<p>This shortage is compounded by brain drain, as healthcare workers seek better opportunities abroad. Ironically, the Philippines is one of the world's leading exporters of healthcare professionals while experiencing critical domestic shortages.</p>
</div>
<div class="more">
<h3>3.Geographic Inequality</h3>
<p>Metro Manila has the greatest density of hospitals, while provinces like Palawan and Agusan del Sur have significantly fewer facilities despite substantial population density [Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]</p>
<p>Rural areas often have populations of 100-300 people per square kilometer served by only one or two hospitals, if any.</p>
</div>
<div class="more">
<h3>4.Fragmented System</h3>
<p>he healthcare system suffers from overlapping financing roles, weak incentives for integrating services across local government units, limited private sector participation in care networks, and fragmented primary health care services [Taylor & Francis Online]. This fragmentation leads to inefficiency and gaps in care coordination.</p>
<p>Implementation Gaps: Some health centers do not receive PhilHealth reimbursements despite filing claims, while others have stopped claiming reimbursements altogether despite providing services [PubMed Central]. This creates a vicious cycle where facilities cannot maintain adequate supplies and equipment, further degrading service quality.</p>
<p>The Philippines has made important legislative commitments to universal healthcare, but translating those commitments into reality requires addressing not just funding levels but the structural, political, and capacity challenges that prevent resources from reaching those who need care most. Without sustained focus on implementation, the promise of Universal Health Care risks remaining more aspiration than reality for millions of Filipinos.</p>
